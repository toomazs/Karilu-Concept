👕 • wanted to share a project i worked on: the redesign of the sports brand <em><b>karilu</b></em>. it started with a full rework of the logo’s aesthetics and color palette to give it a fresh, modern look that fits today’s sports market vibes.  

👨🏽‍💻 • i also built a new official website for <em><b>karilu</b></em> using pure html, css, and internal javascript. the site was designed to be intuitive, clean, and modern — focusing on giving users a smooth and aesthetic browsing experience.
